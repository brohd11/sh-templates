# build/ mirrors a Godot project root, so the zip extracts straight over a project

# Everything inside the $ADDON_SRC source folder is copied recursively, so
# adding new files (or any addon assets) there needs no change to this script.
# LICENSE and README live at the repo root (for GitHub) and are copied in too.
# Compiled libraries are pulled from bin/, preserving subdirectory structure so
# macOS .framework bundles survive intact.
#
# Version comes from `git describe` (exact tag = clean release, -N-g<hash>
# suffix = built past the tag); the version file is only a fallback and the
# PACKAGED copy gets stamped with the resolved version, the source stays
# untouched. Pre-existing build/ and dist/ directories are removed first.
